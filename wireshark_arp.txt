    (a) "Wireshark Lab: Ethernet and ARP: Capturing Ethernet Frames"
            1.  Source - f4:0f:24:0f:cb:f8
            2.  Dest   - 00:00:0c:9f:f2:56. This is not the ethernet address of gaia.cs.umass.edu - this is
                         the ethernet address of the first-hop router.
            3.  0x0800
            4.  The "G" is on the 67th byte


    (b) Why is an ARP query sent within a broadcast frame? 
            - With a broadcast frame, each node has a self-configuring table and the network has a certain
                level of plug-and-play. The broadcast frame is what allows this, because when a node attempts
                to connect/interact with another node when it has moved or has not been discovered yet, it
                will always be reached.
        Why is an ARP response sent within a frame with a specific destination MAC address?
            - The response is sent within the frame with a specific address because the broadcast frame
                contains the source, and so the receiving node knows exactly where to send its response. This
                prevents the network from being  burdened with multiple broadcasts.


    (c) "Wireshark Lab: Ethernet and ARP: The Adress Resolution Protocol"
            12.
                (a) 20 bytes 
                (b) 0000 0000 0000 0001
                (c) yes
                (d) It starts at byte 39
            13. 
                (a) At 21 bytes
                (b) 0000 0000 0000 0010
                (c) At byte 29
            14. Sender MAC - 00:06:25:da:af:73
                Target MAC - 00:d0:59:a9:3d:68
            15. Because we are not the address being queried.


    (d) What is the default amount of time that an entry remains in your ARP cache before being removed?
        Indicate how/where you determined this value.
            20 minutes (man pages)
